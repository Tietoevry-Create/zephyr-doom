= Zephyr-Doom DevContainer

== Introduction

This repository includes a `.devcontainer` directory that defines a
*DevContainer*, which enables reproducible development environments using
*Docker* and *Visual Studio Code*.

DevContainers are especially useful in teams, open-source projects, and CI/CD
workflows where consistent development setup across contributors and machines is
desired.

== Why use DevContainers

* Consistent environment across various operating systems;
* Run your project inside a Docker container with all dependencies
pre-installed;
* Isolate toolchains and libraries without polluting the host system;
* Onboarding new developers becomes much faster;
* Easier integration with CI/CD, testing and debugging in containerized
environments;

For more details, please refer to the official documentation:

* https://containers.dev/[DevContainer documentation]
* https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers[Visual Studio Code documentation]
* https://docs.docker.com/[Docker documentation]

== Prerequisites

Before using this DevContainer, ensure you have the following tools installed:

* https://code.visualstudio.com/Download[Visual Studio Code]
* https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers[Remote - Containers Extension]
* https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/[Docker]

Additionally, you may want to configure:

* *SSH agent forwarding* - this allows your local `ssh-agent` to be propagated
into the `DevContainer`, enabling seamless SSH authentication without repeatedly
entering passphrases or manually adding keys.

* *Git identity environment variables* - to ensure consistent author and
committer information across Git operations within the container, set the
following environment variables on your host system:
** `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME`
** `GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL`
** `GIT_COMMITTER_NAME`
** `GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL`
*** These values are automatically picked up by the initialization scripts and
applied inside the container, avoiding issues with missing or mismatched Git
identity.
*** Alternatively, you can set these values directly in the `git.env` file inside
the `.devcontainer` directory, which will be used to generate the Git config
inside the container.

== How to use in Visual Studio Code

NOTE: Example below is based on a Linux host.

. Clone this repository and open it in Visual Studio Code:
+
[source,bash]
----
git clone git@github.com:Tietoevry-Create/zephyr-doom.git
cd zephyr-doom && code .
----

. Reopen the folder in container:
+
* Press `F1` and select `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`;
* Alternatively, Visual Studio Code might prompt you to reopen in container
automatically;

. Wait for the container to build and start
.. This may take a few minutes the first time.
.. Once the message `Done. Press any key to close the terminal.` appears in the
terminal, the environment is fully set up;

. You are now in a fully configured development environment!

== Directory structure

[source,text]
----
.
├── Dockerfile               # Defines the container image and install dependencies
├── README.adoc              # Documentation explaining the DevContainer usage and setup
├── devcontainer.json        # Main DevContainer configuration file
├── scripts
│   ├── initialize.sh        # Script that runs setup routines before container build
│   ├── setup-git.sh         # Sets up Git configuration inside the container
│   └── setup-nRF-env.sh     # Prepares the Nordic nRF development environment
└── templates
    └── .gitconfig.template  # Template used to generate a Git config inside the container
----

== Known issues

* The `nRF Connect extension` for Visual Studio Code may not initialize
correctly *on the first DevContainer startup*. This is due to parallel execution
of initialization scripts and extension installations.
** To resolve this, simply reopen the DevContainer once the initial build has
completed successfully.

== Limitations

* Docker performance may be slower due to virtualization overhead;

* Container rebuild is required after changing base image or installed packages;

== Troubleshooting

* If you experience issues with the DevContainer environment and need to start
from scratch, try the following:

** Press `F1` in Visual Studio Code and select
`Dev Containers: Rebuild Without Cache and Reopen in Container` option;
+
This will discard cached layers and reinitialize the container environment;

** If problems persist, you can manually remove all previously built and cached
container data using:
+
[source,bash]
----
docker rmi -f $(docker images -q)
docker rm -fv $(docker ps -a -q)
----
+ After cleanup, press `F1` and select
`Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container` to rebuild everything from a
clean state;

* If you encounter persistent issues with the Docker environment itself, you can
try cleaning up all unused Docker resources by running:
+
[source,bash]
----
docker system prune --all --force --volumes
----
+
IMPORTANT: This command will remove all unused containers, images, networks, and
volumes. It may take some time depending on the amount of data being cleaned.
Refer to the official Docker documentation for details ->
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/system_prune/[docker system prune command].
