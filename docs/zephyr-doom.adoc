= Zephyr-Doom

== Introduction

This is a port of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game)[Doom (1993)]
for https://zephyrproject.org/[Zephyr RTOS].

The project is forked from https://github.com/NordicPlayground/nrf-doom[nrf-doom]
(commit https://github.com/NordicPlayground/nrf-doom/commit/2d42413b2c49cda7c60d3cd14b858df1b665533f[2d42413]),
which is forked from https://www.chocolate-doom.org/wiki/index.php/Chocolate_Doom[Chocolate Doom]
version 3.0.0.

The objective of this internship project is to develop a Zephyr port of the
game, making sure it can run on different System-on-Chips (SoCs). This endeavor
will be divided into several stages, presented as Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
packages.

Zephyr-Doom has only been tested with Shareware version of Doom 1.
