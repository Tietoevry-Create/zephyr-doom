= Zephyr-Doom DevContainer

== Introduction

This repository includes a `.devcontainer` directory that defines a
*DevContainer*, enabling reproducible development environment using *Docker* and
*Visual Studio Code*. On Windows, it additionally requires
*Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)*.

DevContainers are especially useful in teams, open-source projects, and CI/CD
workflows where consistent development setup across contributors and machines is
desired.

== Why use DevContainers

* Consistent environment across various operating systems;
* Run your project inside a Docker container with all dependencies
pre-installed;
* Isolate toolchains and libraries without polluting the host system;
* Onboarding new developers becomes much faster;
* Easier integration with CI/CD, testing and debugging in containerized
environments;

For more details, please refer to the official documentation:

* https://containers.dev/[DevContainer documentation]
* https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers[Visual Studio Code documentation]
* https://docs.docker.com/[Docker documentation]

== Prerequisites

Before using this DevContainer, follow the chapters below to set up the basic
environment for your chosen setup.

=== Linux host

Ensure you have the following tools installed:

* https://code.visualstudio.com/Download[Visual Studio Code]
* https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers[Remote - Containers Extension]
* https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/[Docker Engine]

For *helper extensions* installations and *additional configuration* plese refer
to the <<additional-config, Additional configuration>> chapter.

=== Windows host

==== Host instance

NOTE: To avoid potential issues caused by an existing environment configuration,
you may want to start with a fresh WSL instance.

Ensure you have the following tools installed:

* https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install[Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)]
** Extended step by step installation of Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is
available
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual[here].

* https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual#step-6---install-your-linux-distribution-of-choice[Linux distribution] of your choice for Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
** By default it is *the lastest Ubuntu* operating system.

* https://code.visualstudio.com/Download[Visual Studio Code]

* https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.remote-explorer[Remote Explorer Extension]

* https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl[WSL Extension]

* https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers[Remote - Containers Extension]

==== Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) instance

Ensure you have the following tools installed:

* https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/[Docker Engine]

For *helper extensions* installations and *additional configuration* plese refer
to the <<additional-config, Additional configuration>> chapter.

=== Additional configuration [[additional-config]]

Due to licensing restrictions of the
https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/[SEGGER J-Link] tool, if a version other
than the one packaged with the `nRF Command Line Tools` (`794e` - required for
this project's configuration) is needed, it must be downloaded manually and
placed in the `.devcontainer` directory for further installation.

Helper extensions that could be installed:

* https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-containers[Container Tools Extension]
* https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker[Docker Extension]
* https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=docker.docker[Docker DX Extension]

Additionally, you may want to configure:

* *SSH agent forwarding* - this allows your local `ssh-agent` to be propagated
into the `DevContainer`, enabling seamless SSH authentication without repeatedly
entering passphrases or manually adding keys.

* *Git identity environment variables* - to ensure consistent author and
committer information across Git operations within the container, set the
following environment variables on your host system:
** `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME`
** `GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL`
** `GIT_COMMITTER_NAME`
** `GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL`
*** These values are automatically picked up by the initialization scripts and
applied inside the container, avoiding issues with missing or mismatched Git
identity.
*** Alternatively, you can set these values directly in the `git.env` file inside
the `.devcontainer` directory, which will be used to generate the Git config
inside the container.

== How to use in Visual Studio Code

=== Linux host [[how-to-linux-host]]

. Clone this repository (if not done yet):
+
[source,bash]
----
git clone git@github.com:Tietoevry-Create/zephyr-doom.git
----
+
NOTE: To use this method for cloning the repository, you must have an SSH key
pair configured. For details, see the official
https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent[GitHub documentation].

. Open the repository in Visual Studio Code:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd zephyr-doom && code .
----

. Reopen the repository in the container:
+
* Press `F1` and select `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`.
* Alternatively, Visual Studio Code might prompt you to reopen in container
automatically.

. Wait for the container to build and start.
.. This may take a few minutes the first time.
.. Once the message `Done. Press any key to close the terminal.` appears in the
terminal, the environment is fully set up.

. You are now in a fully configured development environment!

=== Windows host

==== Host instance

. Open Visual Studio Code.

. Navigate to the `Remote Explorer` tab.
.. If multiple connection methods are configured, ensure the extension is set to
`WSL Targets`.

. Start the desired distribution (by default, *the latest Ubuntu* version) by
selecting `Connect in Current Window`.
.. In case the *Terminal* is not started to navigate, use the
`CTRL + `` keyboard shortcut.

NOTE: On subsequent launches, if a directory was previously opened in the
Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) instance, one will have the option to load
directly into that directory.

==== Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) instance

Continue with the steps mentioned in the <<how-to-linux-host, next chapter>>.

== Known issues

* The `nRF Connect extension` for Visual Studio Code may not initialize
correctly *on the first DevContainer startup*. This is due to parallel execution
of initialization scripts and extension installations.
** To resolve this, simply reopen the DevContainer once the initial build has
completed successfully.

== Limitations

* Docker performance may be slower due to virtualization overhead;

* Container rebuild is required after changing base image or installed packages;

== Troubleshooting

* If you experience issues with the DevContainer environment and need to start
from scratch, try the following:

** Press `F1` in Visual Studio Code and select
`Dev Containers: Rebuild Without Cache and Reopen in Container` option;
+
This will discard cached layers and reinitialize the container environment;

** If problems persist, you can manually remove all previously built and cached
container data using:
+
[source,bash]
----
docker rmi -f $(docker images -q)
docker rm -fv $(docker ps -a -q)
----
+ After cleanup, press `F1` and select
`Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container` to rebuild everything from a
clean state;

* If you encounter persistent issues with the Docker environment itself, you can
try cleaning up all unused Docker resources by running:
+
[source,bash]
----
docker system prune --all --force --volumes
----
+
IMPORTANT: This command will remove all unused containers, images, networks, and
volumes. It may take some time depending on the amount of data being cleaned.
Refer to the official Docker documentation for details ->
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/system_prune/[docker system prune command].
