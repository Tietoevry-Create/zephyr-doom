== QSPI Flash Upload

. Ensure that the Nordic command line tools are installed (`nrfjprog`).

. Connect the board via USB.

. Erase the external *QSPI flash* and then program it with the data in the
`qspi.hex` file with the following commands:
+
[source,bash]
----
nrfjprog --family nrf53 --qspicustominit --qspieraseall
nrfjprog --family nrf53 --qspicustominit --program qspi.hex --verify
----

== Custom WAD Files [[custom-wad-files]]

If one want to play with the *modified DOOM WAD* file(s):

. Format an SD card to `FAT32` format.
. Copy the *custom WAD file* to the root directory of the SD card.
. Insert the SD card into the card slot connected to the board.
. Hold down *button 2* while restarting the board, which will cause the game to
load the *WAD file* and write it to the *external QSPI flash*.
. The game will now use *custom WAD file*.

The `qspi.hex` file in this folder was created in the following way:

. Download the
https://archive.org/details/DoomsharewareEpisode[DOOM shareware v1.9 WAD file].

. Follow the steps above to upload the *WAD file* to the external *QSPI flash*.

. Use the below command to read the contents of the *QSPI flash* and save it as
`qspi.hex`:
+
[source,bash]
----
nrfjprog --family nrf53 --readqspi qspi.hex
----

== Edit WAD Files

Follow these steps to modify and integrate the *custom WAD file(s)*:

. *Choose a WAD Editor*
** Popular options include:
*** https://slade.mancubus.net[SLADE3] - A versatile editor that handles
graphics, audio, textures, and map editing.
*** https://github.com/jewalky/UltimateDoomBuilder[Ultimate Doom Builder] -
Primarily focused on creating and editing maps.

. *Edit the WAD file*
* Open the *WAD file* using your chosen editor:
** Replace textures or sprites.
** Edit or create new maps.
** Change sound effects or music.

. *Save your custom WAD*
* Save your changes as a *new WAD file* (e.g. `MYDOOM.WAD`).

. *Load your custom WAD onto the board*
* Follow the steps outlined in the <<custom-wad-files, Custom WAD Files>>
chapter to transfer the *edited WAD* onto the board's *external QSPI flash*.

=== Tips

* Always back up the *original WAD file* before editing.
* Ensure that the *custom WAD file* stays within the size limit supported by the
external flash (*8 MiB*).
* Test the *custom WAD file* thoroughly on a desktop DOOM port (like Chocolate
Doom) before deploying it to the board, making the debugging easier.
