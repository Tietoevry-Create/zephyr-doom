= Bluetooth Gamepad

== Overview

This implementation connects a gamepad to the *nRF5340* board over
*Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)*. +
The gamepad sends joystick position and button state data at regular intervals
to the board.

== Requirements

- The https://microbit.org/new-microbit/[micro:bit v2] or compatible board.
- For receiving data, the *nRF5340 DK* or compatible board running the available
in this repository
https://github.com/Tietoevry-Create/zephyr-doom/tree/master/zephyrdoom[zephyrdoom]
code.

== Build/Upload Sources

. *Build the sources*
* Open the sample directory in *Visual Studio Code* using the
*NRF Connect extension* and build the project for appropriate board.
* Functionality was tested on the
https://microbit.org/new-microbit/[micro:bit v2] board using `prj_minimal.conf`
and `app.overlay` files.

. *Upload the sources*
* Connect the gamepad to the computer and copy the
`gamepad/microbit/build/zephyr/zephyr.hex` file to the gamepad.
* The gamepad will automatically restart and launch the application.
* The application will then connect to the *nRF5340* board when it is running.
